A social worker by profession I have always had a very special relationship with doing henna\/Mehandi. I am a self-taught henna artist practicing this art for the last 3 years and have always been committed to providing artistic, professional services and making my clients experience with henna\/Mehandi a unique, enjoyable and an unforgettable one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:14px\">This exquisite form of body art is part of my cultural heritage and I am proud to be able to decorate each bride-to-be with a pattern unique to her personality, including motifs that express her inner dreams and desires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:14px\">Although proficient in many styles of Henna, I treasure traditional Indian bridal designs, and take exacting care with high degree of detail in my work. I love how the Mehandi ceremony fits into the entire celebration of Indian Weddings, and cherish my role as one of many spokes in the wheel, making a couple\u2019s special day truly a memorable occasion. Once I had a parent tell me \u201cYour role is so important in a wedding as it is usually the Mehandi ceremony that kicks off the wedding festivities\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:14px\">I am currently providing henna services throughout the chennai.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:14px\">My henna paste is made with 100% natural Henna powder, lemon juice, and essential oils. I do not use \u201cBlack henna\u201d because I believe it is unethical and dangerous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:14px\">I can do Mehandi\/Henna for just about any occasion. I Specialize in Bridal Mehandi, Sangeet Parties, Engagements, Baby Showers, Birthday Parties, Ladies Night outs, School Events, Corporate Events and Fundraisers. I love to extend this art form onto cakes and other mediums like wood, glass and candles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sandhiya&#8217;s Mehandi Designer My name is Sandhiya, and for over last two and half decades I have been adorning brides and inspiring artists with my Mehandi designs.
